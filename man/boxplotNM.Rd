\title{Side-by-Side Boxplots Displaying Bootstrap Variation by Variable Class}
\usage{
boxplotNM(
  data = bam_covariate_importance,
  group = NULL,
  species = "all",
  bcr = "all",
  traits = NULL,
  plot = FALSE,
  colours = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A `data.frame` containing covariate importance values,
with rows as covariates and columns denoting the relative influence for a given bootstrap replicate by species by BCR permutation.
Defaults to `bam_covariate_importance`.}

\item{group}{A `character` specifying the grouping variable(s) for summarizing the covariate importance (e.g., species, BCR, etc.).}

\item{species}{A `character` specifying the species to filter by. The default is `"all"`, which includes all species in the dataset.}

\item{bcr}{A `character` specifying the Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs) to filter by. The default is `"all"`, which includes all BCRs in the dataset.}

\item{traits}{A `data.frame` containing species traits to include in the analysis (optional).
If `NULL`, traits are not included in the plot.}

\item{plot}{A `logical` indicating whether to plot the results (`TRUE`) or return the processed data (`FALSE`).
Defaults to `FALSE`.}

\item{colours}{A `character` vector of hex codes for the colours to use in the boxplot (optional).
If `NULL`, default colours are used.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing boxplots of relative covariate importance by variable class, grouped by the selected factors.
If `plot = FALSE`, the processed data is returned instead of the plot.
}
\description{
This function generates side-by-side boxplots that show bootstrap variation of covariate importance by variable class,
with options to group by BCR (Bird Conservation Region), species, and other factors.

\examples{
# Example usage with default data:
# boxplotNM(data = bam_covariate_importance, group = "species", species = "all", bcr = "all")

# Example with filtering by BCR and custom colours:
# boxplotNM(data = bam_covariate_importance, group = "species", bcr = c("BCR12", "BCR13"),
#                      colours = c("#1f78b4", "#33a02c"))
}
